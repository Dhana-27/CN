1. Create a Simulator object. 

2. Set routing as dynamic. 

3. Open the trace and nam trace files. 

4. Define the finish procedure. 

5. Create nodes and the links between them. 

6. Create the agents and attach them to the nodes 

7. Create the applications and attach them to the udp agent. 

8. Connect UDP and null. 

9. At 1 sec the link between node 1 and 2 is broken. 

10. At 2 sec the link is up again. 

11. Run the simulation.
